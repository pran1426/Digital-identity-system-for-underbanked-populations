# Digital Identity System for Underbanked Populations

## Introduction

The **Digital Identity System for Underbanked Populations** is a blockchain-based solution designed to provide a secure and decentralized way of managing identity for individuals who lack access to traditional banking systems. This project leverages the Aptos Move programming language to ensure scalability, security, and ease of use, enabling users to register and retrieve their identities efficiently.

## Vision of the Project

Our vision is to create a world where **identity is a fundamental human right**, accessible to everyone regardless of economic status or geographic location. By empowering underbanked populations with a reliable digital identity, we aim to:

- Reduce barriers to accessing financial services.
- Enhance trust in identity verification processes.
- Build a foundation for future decentralized applications targeting inclusivity.

## Features of the Module

1. **Identity Registration**: 
   - Users can securely register their name and national ID.
   
2. **Identity Retrieval**:
   - Users or authorized entities can retrieve stored identities for verification or other purposes.

3. **Decentralization**:
   - The system operates on the Aptos blockchain, ensuring no single point of failure or data manipulation.

4. **Security**:
   - The use of Move’s resource model ensures data safety and prevents unauthorized modifications.

## Future Goals of the Project

The Digital Identity System is a stepping stone toward broader financial and identity inclusion. Future developments include:

1. **Integration with Financial Services**:
   - Enable users to connect their digital identity with decentralized financial services (DeFi) to access microloans, savings accounts, and more.

2. **Identity Verification Protocols**:
   - Introduce multi-party authentication systems to enhance security during identity validation.

3. **Interoperability**:
   - Expand the system to support cross-chain identity management, allowing seamless use across multiple blockchain networks.

4. **Mobile Accessibility**:
   - Develop mobile and web interfaces to make the system user-friendly for people with limited technical knowledge.

5. **Partnerships with NGOs and Governments**:
   - Collaborate with non-profits and public entities to increase adoption in regions with low financial inclusion.
